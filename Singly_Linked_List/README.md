# SINGLY LINKED LIST

## Description
This is a singly linked list implementation in Python. It is a data structure that consists of nodes in a sequence. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. The tail's pointer points to None.

## Usage
To use this singly linked list, you must first import the SinglyLinkedList class from the singly_linked_list.py file. Then you can create a new instance of the SinglyLinkedList class. The SinglyLinkedList class has the following methods:

* `print_list()` - prints the list in a readable format

* `append(value)` - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

* `prepend(value)` - adds a new node with the given value to the beginning of the list

* `insert(index, value)` - adds a new node with the given value at the given index

* `remove_at(index)` - removes the node at the given index

* `pop()` - removes the last node in the list and returns its value

* `pop_first()` - removes the first node in the list and returns its value

* `get(index)` - returns the value of the node at the given index

* `set(index, value)` - sets the value of the node at the given index to the given value
